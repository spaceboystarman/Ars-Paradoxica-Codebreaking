# Ars-Paradoxica-Codebreaking
A program written to break Ars Paradoxica codes (blue for now, red and green coming up). 

To get started, simply replace the word thunderstorms with the weather key given in the show in both places. Make sure that you keep it between the quotation marks, otherwise the program WILL NOT WORK. For example, write "windy" not windy.

After that, replace the numbers below with the numbers listed in the show. Make sure that there is a comma and a space between each number, but nothing else. 

Once you've added your information, run the current chunk. Ignore the numbers its spits out: the last line will have your text.
